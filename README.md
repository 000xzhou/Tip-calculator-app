## My process

I made it the same as the challenge. I did change where the logo going to be. I move it to the left because i wanna add in a color picker at the right. 
There is still things I need to do in this project.
- Animation to hover (so it can look cool?)
- Some other details

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I spend a lot of time thinking how to deal with the input and button press for the tip area. Then when I was working on it using Class. I found out it don't matter. It just works since the class constructor only takes in one input.

### Useful resources

- [theme picker](https://youtu.be/fyuao3G-2qg) - I saw this color picker and had to try it. (reason why I added in the color picker)
